A simple app in Material Design to watch anime from [AnimeUnity](https://www.animeunity.it) on your phone. <br>

## Download
### Android
You can download the app from the latest release [here](https://github.com/aleeeee1/AnimeStream/releases/latest)

### iOS
To get this running on iOS you need to compile it yourself, sorry :/

## Compiling
### Android
`flutter build apk`

### iOS
You can run on your device without an Apple Developer Licence with `flutter run --release` or compile it with Xcode. <br>
It will work for a week then you need to reinstall it.
